The objective of this project is to analyze the diamonds dataset, including exploring its characteristics, preprocessing the data, and building predictive models for regression (predicting diamond prices) The project aims to:

1. Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between features.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, label encoding scaling features if necessary.
3. Conduct hypothesis testing to identify relationships between features and the target variable (price).
4. Build multiple regression models to predict diamond prices based on their characteristics.
5. Evaluate the performance of regression models using appropriate metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. Select the best regression model based on evaluation metrics.
7. Provide insights and recommendations based on model results and analysis.
